Enoch was the TA for three tough courses I took: Business Statistics, Intro to Business Analysis, and Risk Management & Business Intelligence. He's seriously on top of everything - if there was a change or something unexpected, he'd be the first one to drop us an email. Plus, he was the guy who made sure our midterms and finals were well arranged and graded. And he devises questions for some midterms and finals too.

What makes Enoch stand out as a TA is his preparation for every lab session. He'd plan ahead, and tailor his explanations based on what we found tough in class. If we had questions, he'd tackle them one by one, and he'd even throw in some extra info that we didn't get to cover in class because of time.

But Enoch isn't just a fantastic TA, he's also a cracking friend. He's always up for a chat, gets stuck into all kinds of business science activities, and he's pretty big on soccer too, keeping a cool balance between his studies and fitness. Honestly, I reckon most undergrads like me could take a leaf out of his book.

I had a very positive experience in the Risk Management course. The content was challenging yet engaging, providing valuable insights into various risk management strategies and techniques.

Enoch, as the TA for the Risk Management course was truly exceptional. He demonstrated a high level of responsibility and dedication throughout the semester. One thing that stood out was his willingness to answer questions and provides clarifications both during class and outside of class hours. His prompt and helpful responses made it easier for me to grasp complex concepts.

Moreover, his support on my stock model assignment was invaluable. Their insights and assistance helped me navigate through the complexities of the task, resulting in a more comprehensive and well-structured submission.

Enoch has helped me solve many of my study and work problems. Enoch has very solid statistics as well as python skills, I've taken two courses taught by him and he explains obscure statistics very clearly and is good at citing examples to give us a deeper understanding of the points. In addition he is good at expanding the knowledge content so that I can connect my academic knowledge with industry skills..
