# Undergraduate Level:

## **ISOM2500 Business statistics**

This course serves as a core course in business school. The objective of this course is to equip students with basic concepts and methods in statistical thinking and reasoning so that they can handle uncertainty intelligently in business environment effectively. These basis concepts and methods include **descriptive statistics**, **probability**, **statistical inference**, and **linear regression**.The course adopts the following approaches to meet the objectives:

-   Emphasize concepts understanding and results interpretation through different methods of evaluation.

-   Closer connection to real life and business practice through new content of lectures.

-   Hand-on experiences on data collection and analysis through in-class experiments.

## **ISOM2600 Introduction to Business Analytics in Python**

This course introduces students with the foundation needed to apply data analytics to real-world challenges they will confront in their future career. It covers statistical methods in descriptive analytics and predictive analytics, including regression, variable selection. This course provides students with the fundamental concepts and tools needed to understand the emerging role of business analytics in organizations and shows students how to apply basic business analytics methodology using the current popular software, and how to communicate with analytics professionals to effectively use and interpret analytic models and results for making better business decision. Emphasis is placed on statistical reasoning and interpretation of results, rather than proof of theory and coding. Students only use Python language as a tool to analysis data.
