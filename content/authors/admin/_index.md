Hi, welcome to my homepage where you can learn my background and check on my updates. \
I got my Bachelor of science degree in mathematics at HKUST in 2021, while my major is statistics and financial math. My final year's capstone project is on time series analysis and its application to portfolio optimization. Since graduation, I have been working on my current position as an Instructional Assistant and Research Assistant of operational management division of ISOM department. I have been collaborating the work with my supervisors, and working on operation research projects with methods of machine learning, reinforcement learning, classification and clustering, sentiment analysis, time series and so on. \
Currently, I am doing my master degree of statistics in GWU, starting in 2026 Spring. And I am proactively searching for research opportunities in my interested areas.\
My research interests involve topics including finance, and economics with statistical and mathematical methods optimizing the model. And implementing machine learning algorithms in financial market and data science research. I also develop trading strategies as an individual quantitative trader.
